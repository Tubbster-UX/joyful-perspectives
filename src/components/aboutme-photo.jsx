          I take pictures of pretty much everything. I'm growing all the time in my skills. I started out taking a few portraits of some of my friends and realized there are so many possibilities and so much uniqueness with each picture I take, especially if it’s of a person.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">
          So I decided to turn my focus on to practicing taking portraits to get better at it. Doing so I realized how much I love seeing my unique photo style come out in every photo I take.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">
          I decided that my overall goal for photography was to show each and every person I photograph that they’re beautiful and unique just the way they are and that every imperfect thing they find on themselves is actually truly beautiful to God.

          This verse reminds me what my goal of photography is, "I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well."
